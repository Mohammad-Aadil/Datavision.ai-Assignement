        "## Requirements:\n",
        "\n",
        "### 1. Resolution and Quality:\n",
        "- Decide on the video quality, up to 4K.\n",
        "- Make sure the videos look great.\n",
        "\n",
        "### 2. Motion and Dynamics:\n",
        "- Find ways to make the videos move smoothly with cool transitions.\n",
        "\n",
        "### 3. Text Input:\n",
        "- Make it easy for users to type or upload text.\n",
        "\n",
        "### 4. Customization:\n",
        "- Let users change how things look, like fonts, colors, and backgrounds.\n",
        "\n",
        "### 5. Audio Integration:\n",
        "- Think about adding music or voice to the videos.\n",
        "\n",
        "### 6. Output Formats:\n",
        "- Decide what types of files the videos can be saved as.\n",
        "\n",
        "### 7. Personal Use:\n",
        "- Make sure the app is good for personal projects or making content for social media.\n",
        "\n",
        "### 8. User Interface and Experience:\n",
        "- Decide how the app will look and be easy for people to use.\n",
        "\n",
        "### 9. Platform:\n",
        "- Choose where the app will work, like on Windows, Mac, or the web.\n",
        "- Think about anything special needed for development.\n",
        "\n",
        "### 10. Feedback and Adjustments:\n",
        "- Figure out how to handle user feedback and make changes to improve the videos.\n",

        "## Intern Approach Document:\n",
        "\n",
        "### Technical Strategies for High-Resolution and Fluid Motion:\n",
        "To make high-quality videos, we'll use smart video techniques. We'll also make sure the videos move smoothly using cool technology.\n",
        "\n",
        "### User-Friendly Text Input and Customization:\n",
        "We want users to easily type or upload text. Also, they can change how things look, such as fonts and colors, in a simple way.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Audio Integration and Output Formats:\n",
        "We'll decide if the videos will have music or voice. Also, we'll choose different types of files the videos can be saved as.\n",
        "\n",
        "### User Interface Design and Experience Enhancements:\n",
        "We'll make the app look good and be easy for everyone to use. It will have simple buttons and helpful tips.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Development Roadmap:\n",
        "- **Phase 1 (Months 1-2):** Research and make the main video parts.\n",
        "- **Phase 2 (Months 3-4):** Design how the app looks and put everything together.\n",
